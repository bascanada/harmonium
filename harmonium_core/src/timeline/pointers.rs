//! Writehead and Playhead - the two sides of the timeline architecture
//!
//! - **Writehead** (main thread): Generates measures ahead of playback using the
//!   same algorithms as the legacy engine (Sequencer, HarmonicDriver, HarmonyNavigator).
//!   Writes completed `Measure` structs to a ring buffer for the Playhead.
//!
//! - **Playhead** (audio thread): Reads measures from the ring buffer, converts
//!   musical time (steps) to sample time, and emits `AudioEvent`s to the renderer.
//!   Zero allocations in steady state.
